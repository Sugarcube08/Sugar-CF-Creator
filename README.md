# 📞 Sugar Contact-File Creator

A simple Python script to manage and store contact numbers in a text file. The script ensures that only valid 10-digit numbers are stored, removes duplicates, and maintains data integrity. ✅

## ✨ Features
```sh
- 📂 Creates a file for storing contacts if it does not exist.
- 📲 Adds valid 10-digit phone numbers to the file with a `+91` country code.
- 🔄 Prevents duplicate contacts from being stored.
- 🧹 Provides an option to clean the database, removing duplicate entries while preserving order.
- 🚪 Allows the user to exit the program gracefully.
```
## 🛠 Prerequisites
```sh
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🖥 A terminal or command prompt to run the script
```
## 📥 Installation
```sh
1. Clone or download this repository. ⬇️
   git clone https://github.com/Sugarcube08/Sugar-CF-Creator.git

2. Ensure you have Python installed by running:
   python --version

3. Navigate to the script directory in your terminal:
   cd Sugar-CF-Creator
```
## 🚀 Usage
```sh
Run the script using:
python script.py
```
### 🔍 How It Works
```sh
1. 📝 The script prompts the user for a filename to store contacts (default: `contacts.txt`).
2. 🔢 The user enters a 10-digit number, which is stored in the file with a `+91` prefix.
3. 🧹 If the user enters `exit`, the script cleans the database by removing duplicate numbers before exiting.
```
### 📌 Example Run
```sh
Enter file name: contacts.txt
contacts.txt already exists
Enter a 10-digit number (or 'exit' to stop): 9876543210
+919876543210 added successfully
Enter a 10-digit number (or 'exit' to stop): 9123456789
+919123456789 added successfully
Enter a 10-digit number (or 'exit' to stop): exit
Database cleaned successfully
Exiting program.
```
